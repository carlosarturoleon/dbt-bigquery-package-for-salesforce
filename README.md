## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites:

Before using this package, you have to integrate Salesforce data into BigQuery using the [Windsor.ai connector](https://windsor.ai/connect/salesforce-google-bigquery-integration/) to ensure the schema matches the expected format:

1. [Sign up](https://onboard.windsor.ai/) for Windsor.ai's free trial.
2. Connect your Salesforce account(s).
3. Choose BigQuery as a data destination.
4. Create and run a destination task for each of the 5 required tables by selecting specific fields. You can use the Report Presets dropdown to automatically select the necessary fields for each model (campaigns, leads, contacts, campaign_members, opportunities).

## ‚úÖ Required BigQuery tables

These tables must be created with the field structure defined in the sources.yml file:

**campaigns**
- Campaign-level info such as names, types, status, and budgets
- Key fields: id, name, type, status, start_date, end_date, budgeted_cost, actual_cost, is_active

**leads**
- Lead records with contact information and source tracking
- Key fields: id, email, first_name, last_name, company, status, lead_source, created_date, converted_date, converted_contact_id, converted_opportunity_id

**contacts**
- Contact master data with account relationships
- Key fields: id, email, first_name, last_name, account_id, created_date, lead_source

**campaign_members**
- Campaign membership associations linking campaigns to leads/contacts
- Key fields: id, campaign_id, lead_id, contact_id, status, first_responded_date, created_date

**opportunities**
- Sales opportunity pipeline data with campaign attribution
- Key fields: id, name, account_id, amount, stage_name, close_date, campaign_id, created_date, is_closed, is_won

Windsor.ai will stream your Salesforce data to your BigQuery project in minutes. After verifying that the data is present, you're ready to start transforming it using this dbt package.
