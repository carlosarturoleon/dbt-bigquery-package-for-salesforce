## What does this dbt package do?

This package transforms raw Salesforce data into clean, analytics ready tables modeling the complete **Campaign ‚Üí Lead ‚Üí Contact ‚Üí Campaign Member ‚Üí Opportunity** funnel. It provides:

- **Campaign ROI analysis**: Track performance metrics across campaigns
- **Lead conversion tracking**: Monitor progression with timing analytics  
- **Multi touch attribution**: Understand campaign touchpoint impact

## ‚öôÔ∏è Prerequisites:

Before using this package, you have to integrate Salesforce data into BigQuery using the [Windsor.ai connector](https://windsor.ai/connect/salesforce-google-bigquery-integration/) to ensure the schema matches the expected format:

1. [Sign up](https://onboard.windsor.ai/) for Windsor.ai's free trial.
2. Connect your Salesforce account(s).
3. Choose BigQuery as a data destination.
4. Create and run a destination task for each of the 5 required tables by selecting specific fields. You can use the Report Presets dropdown to automatically select the necessary fields for each model (campaigns, leads, contacts, campaign_members, opportunities).

## ‚úÖ Required BigQuery tables

Windsor.ai will stream your Salesforce data to your BigQuery project in minutes. The following tables must be available with the field structure defined in the sources.yml file:

| **Table** | **Status** | **Description** | **Key Fields** |
|-----------|------------|-----------------|----------------|
| `campaigns` | **Required** | Campaign level info such as names, types, status, and budgets | `id`, `name`, `type`, `status`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `budgeted_cost`, `actual_cost`, `is_active` |
| `leads` | **Required** | Lead records with contact information and source tracking | `id`, `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `company`, `status`, `lead_source`, `created_date`, `converted_date`, `converted_contact_id`, `converted_opportunity_id` |
| `contacts` | **Required** | Contact master data with account relationships | `id`, `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `account_id`, `created_date`, `lead_source` |
| `campaign_members` | **Required** | Campaign membership associations linking campaigns to leads/contacts | `id`, `campaign_id`, `lead_id`, `contact_id`, `status`, `first_responded_date`, `created_date` |
| `opportunities` | **Required** | Sales opportunity pipeline data with campaign attribution | `id`, `name`, `account_id`, `amount`, `stage_name`, `close_date`, `campaign_id`, `created_date`, `is_closed`, `is_won` |

After verifying that the data is present, you're ready to start transforming it using this dbt package.

## üèóÔ∏è Package architecture

This package follows dbt best practices with a threenlayer architecture for scalable, maintainable data transformations:

### **Staging models** (`stg_salesforce__*`)
*Purpose*: Clean and standardize raw Salesforce data from Windsor.ai integration

**Transformations applied:**
- Data type standardization and safe casting
- Consistent field naming conventions
- Basic data validation and quality checks
- Null value handling and default assignments
- Deduplication where necessary

**Models in this layer:**
- `stg_salesforce__campaigns` - Campaign master data
- `stg_salesforce__leads` - Lead information and status
- `stg_salesforce__contacts` - Contact details and account relationships
- `stg_salesforce__campaign_members` - Campaign membership associations
- `stg_salesforce__opportunities` - Sales opportunity pipeline data

### **Intermediate models** (`int_salesforce__*`)  
*Purpose*: Business logic, calculations, and relationship modeling

**Transformations applied:**
- Lead journey progression tracking with timing analysis
- Campaign performance metric calculations
- Multi touch attribution logic implementation
- Conversion funnel analysis
- Historical trend calculations

**Models in this layer:**
- `int_salesforce__lead_journey` - Lead lifecycle and conversion tracking
- `int_salesforce__campaign_performance` - Campaign metrics and ROI calculations
- `int_salesforce__contact_touchpoints` - Multi touch interaction history

### **Marts models** (`salesforce__*`)
*Purpose*: Analytics ready tables optimized for business intelligence and reporting

**Optimizations:**
- BigQuery partitioning and clustering for query performance
- Executive dashboard ready data structures
- Pre calculated KPIs and business metrics
- Dimensional modeling for BI tool consumption

**Models in this layer:**
- `salesforce__campaign_lead_funnel` - Complete funnel analysis with conversion metrics
- `salesforce__campaign_attribution_summary` - Multi touch attribution reporting
